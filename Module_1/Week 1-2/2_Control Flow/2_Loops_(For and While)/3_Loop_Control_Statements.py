# Python provides control statements to alter the loop execution. These include:

# break – Exits the loop prematurely
# continue – Skips the current iteration and continues with the next iteration
# pass – Does nothing, acts as a placeholder

for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 4:
        break
    print(i)
